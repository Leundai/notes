# Deep Work

## Value of Deep Work

### Changing economy

Deep work in the current economy is more valuable than ever and
and there are about 3 particiular types of people that will find success in
this kind of economy.

1. Super stars
2. The owners
3. The high skilled workers

This is in direct response to the globalization of work. Remote jobs have opened
up the job market for many companies. Why hire someone that is OK locally
when you can hire the top of the line remotely and or reach out to them easily
for relocation.

Highlighting #3 there is a need for quick adaptation to new technologies and this
will be especially relevant to those that are able to master new AI tools.

### The key aspects of being a winner in this economy

1. Quickly and deeply understand new concepts
2. **Produce** work at an elite level very fast

This can be explained through the equation:

High-quality work produced = (Time spent) x (Intensity of focus)

### Exceptions

Keep in mind that some jobs don't require deep understanding. This can include 
positions at executive level. But again, for a software engineer this is an obvious 
answer that deep knowledge is vital.
